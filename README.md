# Contact-Management-System--DSA

Introduction
A Contact Management System is a software application designed to efficiently store, organize, and manage personal or professional contact details. In today’s digital world, maintaining contacts manually in notebooks or scattered files becomes difficult and inefficient. This system provides a computerized solution that allows users to easily add, view, search, update, and delete contact information such as name, phone number, and email address. The main purpose of developing this Contact Management System is to offer a simple, fast, and user friendly interface that helps users to manage their contacts without any data loss. The system is implemented using the C programming language with concepts like structures, pointers, linked lists, functions, file handling, and data storage. It also includes an Undo feature using a stack, which allows rollback of the last added contact.  This project not only helps in learning practical implementation of data structures but also demonstrates how software can simplify daily tasks. It can be further enhanced by adding graphical user interface, advanced search filters, and cloud-based synchronization for real-world use.

Conclusion  
   
The Contact Management System project provided valuable hands-on experience in implementing data structures such as linked lists and stacks, along with concepts of file handling and modular programming in C. Through this project, practical understanding of how data can be efficiently stored, retrieved, and managed was significantly enhanced.

This project strengthened problem-solving skills and improved understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, particularly encapsulation, abstraction, and modular code design. The integration of features like sorting, searching, and undo operations demonstrated how fundamental computer science concepts can be applied to create real-world, user-centric applications.

Moreover, the project aligns with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 9 – Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure, which focuses on building resilient infrastructure, promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and fostering innovation. By developing a digital solution that promotes organized data management, this system contributes to innovation and digital transformation in information management.
Overall, the project not only enhanced technical proficiency but also highlighted the importance of sustainable, efficient, and innovative software solutions in today’s digital world.
